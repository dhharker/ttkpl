TTKPL - Temporo-Thermal Kinetic Prediction Library

This library is for predicting the totality of kinetic reactions over time. It estimates the
temperature of samples using interpolated global climate data and takes into account the burial
environment of the sample to model the temperature of the sample throughout its burial (and
optionally later phases of e.g. museum storage). From this historical temperature estimate, the
total quantity of a given chemical reaction is estimated and this has various exciting uses:
 * Predict fragment length distribution of ancient DNA (curatorial screening tool)
 * Give expected values for other reactions (currently starch gellation and amino acid racemisation)
 * "Work backwards" to provide access to diagenetic quantification as a sample dating proxy
 * More clever stuff than this! Papers are currently under preparation.

This code won't work on windows, and has some additional deps. This has been developed so far on
Ubuntu, for that/debian you'll need the additional packages nco to access PMIPII data, texlive-base
and php5-gd to generate reports.
